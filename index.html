      <h2>Present</h2>
      <p>I'm a new student of Spring batch, pursueing master's degree in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri
        State University, Maryville, MO. Computer Science is my area of interest all the time. As my under graduation is
        done in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering at K L University I'm having knowledge on both electronics
        subjects and computers subjects too. I have many certifications like python, Tableau and Visual Analytics, and I
        have done my final year project in the stream of Cyber Security.</p>
